# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Common examples include:

- Classification: Predicting categories
- Regression: Predicting numerical values

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples:

- Clustering: Grouping similar data points
- Dimensionality reduction: Reducing data complexity

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions through trial and error.

## Common Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous values
2. **Decision Trees**: For classification and regression
3. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method using multiple trees
4. **Neural Networks**: For complex pattern recognition

## Getting Started

To begin with machine learning:

1. Understand the fundamentals of statistics
2. Learn Python and libraries like scikit-learn
3. Practice with real-world datasets
4. Build and evaluate models
5. Deploy models to production

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a powerful tool that's transforming industries. Start with the basics and gradually work your way up to more advanced concepts.
